### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a fourth-year student of Computational Modeling and Data Analytics (CMDA) at Virginia Tech with minors in mathematics and computer science! Although "data analytics" is the well-known part of this field, my current interests are spanning and open. 

---
### Interests
I take particular interests in large-scale machine learning and computation as well as data-driven modeling of large-scale dynamical systems. My other interests include data science, data pipelining, inventive and interactive data visualization, and software development.

### Experience
As of the summer of 2023, I have currently and proudly been interning with the Hume Center for National Security and Technology at Virginia Tech. Under the guidance of a supervisor, I have been developing a research project on the learning of various Generative Adversarial Networks applied to image data collected from public Instagram photos.

Given my interests and background, I would love to collaborate with those of similar interests to learn more and sharpen my skills critical to navigating this novel and fascinating, though challenging field.
